# 🍗 Chicken Tinder

A **Tinder-style dinner decision app** that helps groups (or indecisive individuals) figure out **where to eat** — one swipe at a time. Built with **React**, **Express**, and the **Yelp API**, this app makes the age-old “What do you want to eat?” question... actually fun.

## 🤔 What is it?

Chicken Tinder turns restaurant picking into a game:

- Swipe right 👍 if you're into the restaurant.
- Swipe left 👎 if you're not feeling it.
- When everyone swipes right on the same place — it’s a match made in flavor heaven.
